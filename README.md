## Efficient Algorithms for large PDB Database

Implementation of two data structures - **linked list** and **hashmap** to store and manage biological data, specifically atoms of a protein sequence from a PDB file. This aims to compare the two data structures in terms of access of atoms to perform biological computations on it.
